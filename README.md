# Isomorphic web application with Mithril.js

**Isomorphic JavaScript webapps** have been around for a while. The benefits are multiple: SEO (crawlable urls), 
performance (faster first render, interaction and navigation) and maintainability (less code, shared by both the client 
and the server, no duplicate logic).

This repository contains the code of the website:

[http://isomorphic-mithril.mvlabs.it](http://isomorphic-mithril.mvlabs.it)

which is a showcase of the challenges that we faced implementing an isomorphic web application. 
The aim is to present a real case study where we chose **Mithril** for its speed, simplicity and elegance. 
We will show the solutions we used to solve the common problems for this kind of app.
